PADL:
  
  1a) Ridge regression model trained with polynomial features
  1b) Linear and Lasso regression compared on R^2
  1c) Linear regression with polynomial feature expansion

  2a) K-means clustering and PCA visualisation
  2b) K-means cluster on PCA reduced data
  2c) Evaluation of clustering on original and PCA reduced data

  3a) Loads data and trains a word2vec skipgram model, giving similarity scores for the target node
  3b) Writes each node to a text file, in order of their similarity to the original target node

  4) Multi-Layer-Perceptron that predicts Waist Circumference using other anthropic measurements. Uses a variety of feature engineering methods, before selecting the best features via LassoCV.

  5) Convolutional Neural Network that performs image classification on images of garments (clothes). Makes use of Squeeze and Excitation blocks to help with regularisation.

  6) Neural network image encoder and decoder for reconstructing images, uses a hybrid MSE and SSIM loss function to improve accuracy.
